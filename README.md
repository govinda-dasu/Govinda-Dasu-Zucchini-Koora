The Govinda Dasu South Indian Telugu Zucchini Koora

Govinda Dasu is neutral about Zucchini. He feels that sometimes it is kind of good. However, it is certainly not his favorite. He much prefers aloo fry. That being said, his parents want him to eat green vegetables, so they make him eat Zucchini. And, it is soft and doesn’t require too much chewing, so he finds it kind of good sometimes with annam (cooked rice), pappu charu annam, or perugu annam (yogurt rice).
